# Part 1: System Setup: Uclax Web 1: Windows

[Back to Main](../../../../readme.md)

## Pre Installation: Important Please Read

-   This tutorial covers Windwows 11 which is required for this course. If you are using Windows 10, in theory, as long as you have the latest version of 10 - you should be able to complete this setup. However, this has not been tested and you will have to resolve any differences that are not supported by your Operating System.
-   Make sure your Operating System is up to date
    -   Windows Search > `Check for Updates`
    -   Rinse and repeat until there are no more updates
-   Unlike macOS and Linux (at least out of the box), Windows does not support bash/terminal. In order to get Windows to act more like macOS and Linux, we need to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
-   Most of the time, you will want to open up apps as Administrator (e.g. **"Run as Administrator"**). This is called out throughout this setup tutorial
-   I am using Parallels WIndows 11 on MacOS. Its close to a 1:1 Windows, but not 100%. So there may be differences for us to troubleshoot.

## Install Windows WSL, Ubuntu and VS Code

_Note: When you run these installations scripts at some point your computer will restart. Please make sure to save any work and close out of any unlreated applications._

## Setup and Connect to Github

Git and Github are essential tools used by developers to share and collaborate on application code. You will be submitting all of your work through Github. We will also use this to collaborate when you run into issues with the lessons and your final project.

### Create and/or Login to Github

1. Sign up for a [Github account](https://github.com/join)
