# Part 2: Shared Setup (Operating System Agnostic)

[Back to Main](../SETUP.md)

## Step 1: Create Github Account

Git and Github are essential tools used by developers to share and collaborate on application code. You will be submitting all of your work through Github. We will also use this to collaborate when you run into issues with the lessons and your final project.

### Create and/or Login to Github

1. Sign up for a <a href="https://github.com/join" target="github">Github account</a>
2. Log in to your <a href="https://github.com/login" target="github">Github account</a>

### Adding SSH Keys

SSH keys are a secure way to connect to your Github account without having to constantly provide username and password.

1. After logging into your Github account, click your **profile icon** upper right
2. Click **Settings**
3. In left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG Keys**

    - <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux" target="sshSetup">Add SSH Keys to **Windows WSL (Linux)**</a>

### Set default repo branch to master

1. After logging into your Github account, click your **profile icon** upper right
2. Click **Settings**
3. In left sidebar, click **Repositories**

5. Click **Update**

### Connect your Project to a new Github Repo

1. After logging into your Github account, click on the **Plus Symbol** in upper right
2. Click **New Repository**
3. Fill in **Repository name:** UCLAX-WEB1-Last-First (e.g. UCLAX-WEB1-Gohman-Mitch)
4. Leave everything else as is (e.g. Public, defaults, etc)
5. Click **Create Repository** button at bottom
6. Make suer SSH (not https) is checked
7. Click the Copy button of the second section "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"
8. Back in VS Code, in your existing open terminal from prior steps (if you closed out **Menu > Terminal > New Terminal**)
9. Paste your clipboard into the terminal, press enter
10. Once it is done, you can refresh your repo in the browser and you will see your project is now connected.
