# Mailtrap

[Back to Overview](./1.Overview.md)

Mailtrap provides a “sandbox” environment where outgoing emails (e.g., from development and staging environments) are intercepted and stored. These emails never reach actual recipients, which is ideal for testing purposes. Developers can preview emails, debug issues, and ensure that email templates are displayed correctly across different email clients.

We will be using Mailtrap to test sending emails from our website contact form.
