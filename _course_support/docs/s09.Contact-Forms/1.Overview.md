# Contact Forms

Sending emails takes an act of Congress to execute - mainly because people want to avoid spam and abuse. Since our website is publicly exposed we want to do the same.

Even without spam concerns, we need to be able to test our Contact form emails without worrying about setting up a mail server.

## So we need:

-   **Mailtrap**: Test Email Server Sandbox
    -   Free
    -   Easy to set up
    -   You have to log into the sandbox to see your emails. Not meant for production
-   **Resend or Brevo**: Production Email Server
    -   They have free versions, which we will use
    -   paid for versions are preferred in Production
    -   To make them official - you have to set them up with a personal Domain - something that is not required for the course - and outside the scope. Our app will support it, and if you are willing - can easily set it up.

## Shared Configuration

1. Open `.env` in the root of your project and Update the following environment variables:
2. `EMAIL_PROVIDER` = `mailtrap` to start (change to `resend` or `brevo` if using those services)
3. `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` Update with your name and email (Must follow the format "First Last <email@somedomain.com>")

## Mail Server Provider Specific Configurations

1. [Setup Mailtrap](./2.Mailtrap.md)
2. [Setup Resend](./3.Resend.md)
3. [Setup Brevo](./4.Brevo.md)
4. [Setup Google reCAPTCHA](./5.Google-Recaptcha.md)
