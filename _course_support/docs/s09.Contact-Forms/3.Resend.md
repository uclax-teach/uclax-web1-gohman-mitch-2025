# Sending Emails with Resend

[Back to Overview](./1.Overview.md)

**Resend** is a developer-friendly service designed to simplify sending transactional emails. It provides a clean API and lightweight integrations, allowing developers to send, track, and manage emails programmatically. Resend is particularly focused on speed, ease of use, and delivering emails reliably without unnecessary complexity.

This is one of the Production options for a **Email Service Provider**. While it is not required for the course, for those that would like their contact forms to actually send to thei personal inbox - you will want to set this up. It also assumes that you own a Domain and Hosted space (e.g. Render). Once you connect your domain, you can use this in production.
