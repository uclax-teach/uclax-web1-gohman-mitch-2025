# Parallels Windows 11 for Instruction

This is my setup for Emulating Windows 11 on my Mac so I can demo setup in video.

## Free Trial

Parallels offers a 30-day free trial. Seems to still work, just keep pressing continue with Free Trial.

## Obtaining Windows 11

looks like when you install Parallels, all I need to do is create New and choose Windows 11. Parallels does the rest.

## Enabled Windows Hypervisor Platform

Since I am using Parallels, I need to enable this feature.

1. Windows Search > **turn features on/off**
2. Enable: **Windows Hypervisor Platform**
